I made a display like this to make it easier for users, especially those who are new to how to use it, no need to switch from page to perform certain actions, everything is on one page such as add, edit, delete, and search. using the default UI from Android, namely Material UI to facilitate the development process.

some functions like search by size and area don't work due to lack of time and busy sprint development for this week
